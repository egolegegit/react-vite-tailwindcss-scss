## Getting started

The main purpose of this was I was too lazy to start everything from scratch, such as setting up config for tailwind, absolute path, jsxinject, etc.
so I create this to solve those problem, and you can use this too, you know, just clone this repo and start developing your next React application with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

#### Feature

> - Fast, use Vite.JS instead C-R-A
> - Tailwindcss / Dark mode enabled (for class)
> - SCSS default
> - Absolute path configured
> - JIT enabled by default
> - Jsx inject configured
> - Prop-Types added
> - Eslint, Prettier and VSCode configured (.vscode for tailwind intellisense)
> - react-dom
> - react-router-dom
> - react-scripts
> - React-Icons for ease of use icons in React app
> - prop-types
> - lodash
